# Context data


You can use the context data in the RoutingContext to maintain any data that you want to share between handlers for the lifetime of the request.

Hereâ€™s an example where one handler sets some data in the context data and a subsequent handler retrieves it:

You can use the put to put any object, and get to retrieve any object from the context data.

A request sent to path /some/path/other will match both routes.
```java
router.get("/some/path").handler(routingContext -> {

  routingContext.put("foo", "bar");
  routingContext.next();

});

router.get("/some/path/other").handler(routingContext -> {

  String bar = routingContext.get("foo");
  // Do something with bar
  routingContext.response().end();

});
```
Alternatively you can access the entire context data map with data.
