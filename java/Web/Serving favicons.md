Serving favicons
Vert.x-Web includes the handler FaviconHandler especially for serving favicons.

Favicons can be specified using a path to the filesystem, or by default Vert.x-Web will look for a file on the classpath with the name favicon.ico. This means you bundle the favicon in the jar of your application.
